# How to Make a Robot

#Robot
An electromechanical device which is capable of reacting in some way to its environment, and take autonomous decisions or actions in order to achieve a specific task.


# Let's get started
Instead of building one robot, you should try to learn how to use indidual components with the objective.

Robotics incorporates aspects of many disciplines including engineering (mechanical, electrical, computer), sciences (mathematics and physics) and arts (aesthetics) and users are free to use their imagination.

Step1 : 
The first step is to determine what your robot should do(i.e. what its purpose in life). 

Step2 :




# Voltage

# Current

# Motor

# Sensors
